            What happens when you try to sell a house with an overgrown
            garden, cracks in the driveway, and a broken front door? No
            offers, right? That&apos;s exactly why you need the best homepage
            design for your website.<br />
            Think of your homepage as analogous to a home&apos;s curb appeal.
            It&apos;s the first thing many people see when they
            <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-users-leave-a-website/" class="page-link">visit your website</a>
            , so you want to wow them from the second the
            <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/speed-up-your-website/" class="page-link">page loads.</a>
            <br />
            But it&apos;s not just about aesthetics. You also want your
            homepage to convert. As I said above, a broken front door and an
            inaccessible driveway prevents future buyers from even considering
            the sale. The same goes for your website.<br />
            People can&apos;t or won&apos;t convert if you don&apos;t give
            them an incentive to do so and if you don&apos;t make converting
            as easy and intuitive as possible.<br />
            The first step in winning over more customers is to understand the
            essential elements that should go into every homepage.<br />
            Once you&apos;ve mastered the basics, draw inspiration from 31 top
            homepage designs so you can find out what will work best for your
            business and your audience.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            The Benefits of a Well-Designed Homepage
          </h2>
          <p class="description">
            A simple homepage design welcomes your audience to your site,
            tells them what you want them to do next, and allows them to
            explore your site in more depth.<br />
            You can add complexity to a simple homepage design, but you
            don&apos;t want to start with a cluttered mess and have to
            selectively prune it. Always begin with the basics.<br />
            What do you need on your homepage? What will your audience expect?
            And which elements take priority?<br />
            When you can answer those questions, you&apos;ll have the
            information you need for better homepage design. In web design,
            homepage elements have very specific purposes.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">
            Helping your target audience get to know your business
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Many of your website visitors will find your homepage first. With
            that in mind, you need to make a solid first impression.<br />
            Your homepage should provide a sense of your company&apos;s
            values, unique selling proposition (USP), and purpose. You&apos;re
            more likely to lure in potential customers if you can effectively
            communicate this information.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">
            Improving the
            <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/improve-user-experience/" class="page-link">user experience on your
              website</a>
          </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Consumers visit your website with a purpose. It could be to check
            out your product line, read your blog posts, or find out if you
            sell a particular type of service.<br />
            Regardless, you want to direct that consumer to the appropriate
            page. Your homepage design should facilitate this transition by
            providing intuitive navigation and a sense of how your website
            flows.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Accruing more conversions</h3>
          <p class="description">
            You want website visitors to convert, but they won&apos;t if you
            don&apos;t give them the necessary incentive and opportunity.
            Maybe you want to build an email list, but if visitors can&apos;t
            find a signup form, your database will remain empty.<br />
            By making this information easily accessible on your homepage, you
            will see an uptick in conversions.<br />
            Another way to boost conversions is to create a strong first
            impression with your homepage. If visitors enjoy their experience
            on your website, they&apos;ll also be more likely to remember it
            in the future. Maybe you won&apos;t make a sale today, but that
            customer will return days or weeks later and buy from you.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Improving brand awareness</h3>
          <p class="description">
            Make your company memorable by allowing your brand image and
            messaging to come through on every page. This is especially true
            when it comes to your homepage design because the homepage serves
            as the gateway to the rest of your website.<br />
            <a href="https://www.anarieldesign.com/how-to-design-a-logo-for-your-wordpress-site/" class="page-link">Your
              logo</a>
            , tagline, and purpose need to take center stage. In fact, you
            might even want to add a form or statement to the very top of your
            homepage — preferably in a large font — that gives your visitors a
            sense of what you do:<br />
            What problems do you solve for your customers? How do you improve
            your clients&apos; lives — whether personal or professional?<br />
            Don&apos;t force your website audience to have to figure out and
            guess what it is you do. Make it clear from the get go.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">How to Design a Website Homepage</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Now that you know the four goals to motivate your design
            principles, ask yourself three guiding questions: What do you
            absolutely need on your homepage? Who is your target audience and
            what will they expect? Which elements take priority?<br />
            Once you have the answers to these three questions, you can begin
            plotting out how best to improve your homepage. Remember to tie
            each of your
            <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/how-design-website-layout/" class="page-link">design elements</a>
            to one of the four goals listed above. Most importantly,
            don&apos;t worry about getting it perfect. Website optimization is
            an ongoing process!
